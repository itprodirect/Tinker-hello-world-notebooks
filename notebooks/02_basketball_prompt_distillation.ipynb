    "1. **Check the environment & imports**\n",
    "   - Confirm Python, Tinker SDK, Transformers, and OpenAI are available.\n",

    "2. **Define the scouting report schema**\n",
    "   - Decide exactly what fields every JSON report must contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create hand-written gold examples**\n",
    "   - A few high-quality scouting examples in query/response format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Save the dataset to JSONL**\n",
    "   - Store examples as `{\"query\": ..., \"response\": ...}` lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Design the teacher prompt**\n",
    "   - A carefully written instruction template that converts raw notes → JSON.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook we went from **scratch** to a working, domain-tuned scouting model using **Tinker + LoRA**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defined a structured scouting schema**  \n",
    "   We decided what information matters for our use case (role, strengths, weaknesses, projection, etc.) and expressed it as a JSON schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Created a few high-quality “gold” examples**  \n",
    "   We hand-wrote scouting reports (free-form text + JSON).  \n",
    "   These examples set the tone, vocabulary, and level of detail we want the model to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Used a teacher model to generate synthetic data**  \n",
    "   With the OpenAI Responses API, we converted a small set of seed notes into additional\n",
    "   input/output pairs and saved them to:\n",
    "\n",
    "   `data/basketball_distillation/scouting_examples.jsonl`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Converted the dataset into Tinker’s supervised format**  \n",
    "   Each example became an `{\"input\": ..., \"output\": ...}` pair and was wrapped as a\n",
    "   `types.Datum` with:\n",
    "   - `model_input` tokens  \n",
    "   - `target_tokens`  \n",
    "   - per-token `weights` to say which tokens should contribute to loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ran a LoRA training loop on a small open model**  \n",
    "   Using `training_client.forward_backward(..., loss_fn=\"cross_entropy\")` and\n",
    "   `training_client.optim_step(...)`, we fine-tuned  \n",
    "   `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B` on our scouting dataset and watched the loss per token drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Saved the trained weights and created a sampler**  \n",
    "   We called:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   sampling_client = training_client.save_weights_and_get_sampling_client(\n",

    "## Final Comparison Summary (Base Model vs Fine-Tuned Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this advanced section, we compared the **base model** and our **fine-tuned basketball‑scouting model**. We only showed the examples where at least one model produced valid JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what the results demonstrate in a simple, straightforward way:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Spot‑up 3‑and‑D Wing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fine‑tuned model** produced clean, structured scouting JSON.\n",
    "* **Base model** did not produce valid JSON for this example.\n",
    "* The fine‑tuned output followed our intended scouting schema and stayed on-topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Training‑Style Example #1**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Base model** produced valid JSON, but the structure was random and unrelated to scouting.\n",
    "* **Fine‑tuned model** produced a detailed, accurate scouting report with the correct fields.\n",
    "* Clearly shows the difference between “generic JSON” and “task‑aligned JSON.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Training‑Style Example #2**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Base model** again returned JSON, but with inconsistent and irrelevant keys.\n",
    "* **Fine‑tuned model** produced a structured report that fit the player type perfectly (small‑ball 5 / rim‑running big).\n",
    "* The fine‑tuned model consistently used fields like `offense_summary`, `defense_summary`, `intangibles`, and `projection`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What This Means**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **base model** sometimes outputs valid JSON, but the content is unpredictable and not usable for scouting.\n",
    "* The **fine‑tuned model** is trained on a tiny dataset, so it isn’t perfect—but when it succeeds, the output is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Structured correctly\n",
    "  * Domain‑specific\n",
    "  * Immediately useful for analysis, apps, or downstream tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This optional evaluation highlights the real win from our prompt‑distillation process:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **We aren’t just getting JSON—we’re getting the right JSON, in the right format, for the job we care about.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This reinforces the value of fine‑tuning even with small datasets, especially for domain‑specific workflows like basketball scouting."
